# Lesson 0: Spring Boot 101

Before Spring Boot, Spring is a hell of dependency, configuration and metadata. A java project can end up with dozens or hundreds of libraries, and you have to define every library, specify their versions and manage their dependencies in that little pom.xml. 

Spring Boot lifts this heavy burden from developers. It has much better Developer Experience (DX).

1. Its starter way of configuration handles dependencies and provides default configuration. When you include a starter, say Spring Web, it has already included all the libraries related to that funtion and handled the version and dependencies among it. 
    ```xml title="Define starter in pom.xml"
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    ```
2. It provides [spring initializr](https://start.spring.io/) to generate the project template. And it just contains 4 files in the beginning... pom.xml, application.properties, xxxApplication.java and xxxApplicationTests... And you can already start it with Tomcat being the default server.

3. It promotes great use of annotation instead of the setting them in xml. It has been used in former spring, but I would say it promotes this even further.

4. It has provided some basic actuators, allowing you health check your application.

    ```xml title="pom.xml"
        <dependency>
		    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
		    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
		</dependency>
    ```

    ```yml title="application.yml"
    management:
        endpoints:
            metrics:
            enabled: "true"
            web:
            exposure:
                include: "health,stale"
        endpoint:
            health:
            show-details: always
            beans:
            enabled: "true"
    ```
5. The community now all follows the starter approach and package their library nicely.
