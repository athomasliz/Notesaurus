## Concept

- Hash is a one way, non-reversible function. Never ask "How can I decrypt my password stored in our database?". We won't encrypt password and store in the database. We usually hash password with salt (for randomness) and appropriate hash function ( like Argon2, Bcrypt etc. These algorithm makes the hash calculation slow, RAM intensive so that hacker is difficult to crack the passwords in short time by brute force) and put in the database.
- Never hash with SHA2, especially on MAC or secret. Use HMAC always.
- Below is the process of using asymmetric cryptography.
    - **Key exchange** between sender A and receiver B
      - A generates key pair, B generates key pair. or using DH or ECDH.
      - A and B sends each other their own public key. A holds B's public key. B holds A's public key. 
      - Private key will be kept by yourself, and never be sent to anyone.
    - **Encrypt and Sign** By A
      - A encrypts plain text (The target is usually small size symmetric key, which will then become hybrid encryption) with B's public key to produce cipher text.
      - A signs something (depends on the protocol) with A's private key to produce digital signature. 
    - A sends B **cipher text** and **signature**.
    - **Decrypt and Verify** By B   
      - B verifies the signature with A's public key.
      - B decrypts the cipher text with B's private key to produce plain text.   
- Asymmetric Encryption encrypts data of limited size (e.g. at most 245 byte for RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 with 2048 bit key). That is why hybrid encryption is needed.
- For those complex theories and algorithms in cryptography ... to a software engineer but not a cryptanalyst, they are good to know but not a must. What a software engineer must know is, for security's sake, which algorithm, primitive and protocol is safe and suitable for him to use, and what standards and best practices he must pay attention and follow.
