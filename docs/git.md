# GIT

|* Term *|* Description *|
|--------|---------------|
|4 object types| commit / tree / blob / annotated tag|
|SHA-1|An alphanumeric sequence of 40 characters representing a hexadecimal number.|
|Blobs|Binary files<br/>Everything is compressed and transformed into a blob before archiving it into a Git repository.<br/>An object, whatever it is, will always have the same hash in any repository, in any computer, on the face of the Earth.<br/>If you have two different files with the same content, even if they have different names and paths, in Git you will end up having only one blob.|
|.git folder||
|commit|Every commit has a parent, and following these relations between commits, we can always navigate from a random one down to the first one, the already mentioned root commit.<br/>First commit did not have a parent. Git, while navigating and reconstructing our repository, simply knows it is done when it finds a commit without a parent.|
|Doesn't do deltas|Git doesn't do deltas (at least not in this case), and every commit is actually a snapshot of the entire repository.|
|Unreachable commits|It simply won't delete unreachable commits, at least not immediately. It makes some housekeeping automatically at a given time, as it has some powerful garbage collection features|
|Working Tree --> Staging Area --> HEAD||
