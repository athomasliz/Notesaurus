# About this site

## What is this site?

Very often when I learn or look into something, I google, spot stackoverflow, read the solutions, perhaps mark the websites, and then oops... A month later, I forget about it.

When someone asks me, most likely "I remember I search something similar before" "I did it before... in my previous project" are my responses.

If something is really important, it should be kept in a reachable place in decent manner.

As such, I create this personal site, hosting my study notes, cheatsheets, links and blogs, for my own or perhaps your own good. 

It is sort of a diary that keeps my technical footprint, at the same time jots down what a newbie should understand in step by step manner.

Just like a metroidvania game, in the beginning, the player cannot go everywhere until he acquires some special abilities or items. As he grows stronger, he can then access most part of the world.
