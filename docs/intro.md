# About this site

## What is this site?

Very often when I look into something, I first google it, spot related topics in stack overflow, glimpse the conversations for hints, try the solution, and fix the bug. Perhaps I may mark the websites, perhaps not... A month later, I forget about it.

> "I did search something similar before... in my previous project" 

> "I wrote it before, let me find the codes"

Shouldn't it be kept in a reachable place in systematic manner? The problems are always habit, overhead, channel, blah blah blah.

I finally manage to create this personal site, hosting my notes, code snippets, links, cheatsheets and blogs, solely for my own good... So I won't deliberate concepts in full.

It is sort of a diary that keeps one's technical footprint, at the same time jotting down what a newbie should understand in a step by step, lesson by lesson manner.

Just like a metroidvania game, in the beginning, a player cannot go everywhere until he acquires some special abilities or items. As he grows stronger, he can access most part of the world.
