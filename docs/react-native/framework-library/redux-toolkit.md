> Redux Toolkit contains packages and functions that we think are essential for building a Redux app. Redux Toolkit builds in our suggested best practices, simplifies most Redux tasks, prevents common mistakes, and makes it easier to write Redux applications.Because of this, Redux Toolkit is the standard way to write Redux application logic. The "hand-written" Redux logic you've written so far in this tutorial is actual working code, but you shouldn't write Redux logic by hand - we've covered those approaches in this tutorial so that you understand how Redux works. However, for real applications, you should use Redux Toolkit to write your Redux logic.
